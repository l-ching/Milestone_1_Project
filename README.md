### Background:
As global temperatures increase every year due to climate change, itâ€™s important to understand how changing climate patterns, especially more frequent, longer lasting, and hotter heat waves, will affect humans. Prolonged exposure to high temperatures disables the body from cooling itself through sweating. Heat stress can result in heat exhaustion and heat stroke, which can be fatal if left untreated. High temperatures can also worsen pre-existing conditions like cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. This project includes analysis of yearly temperature anomalies and heat-related mortality data to analyze the effects of extreme heat on human health in the US. We then contextualized our US findings by analyzing global temperatures.
